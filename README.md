## Requirements
The Trusona SDK requires Ruby version 2.4.0 or higher.

## Examples

* [Installation](#installation)
* [Configuration](#configuration)
* [Device and User Bindings](#device-and-user-bindings)
* [Trusonafications](#trusonafications)
* [Devices](#devices)

### Installation

The recommended way to add the Trusona gem to your project is to use `bundler`. To add
Trusona to your project, add the following line to your `Gemfile`.

`gem 'trusona'`

After adding the line to your `Gemfile`, running `bundle install` will install it.

The Trusona gem uses semantic versioning, so it is generally a good idea to lock in the
major version in your `Gemfile` before deploying to production.

### Configuration

Configuring the Trusona gem is easy. We recommend using environment variables and a tool like [dotenv](https://github.com/bkeepers/dotenv) for managing those environment variables.

```ruby
Trusona.config do |c|
  c.tru_codes_host = ENV['TRUCODES_HOST']
  c.api_host       = ENV['TRUSONA_API_HOST']
  c.secret         = ENV['TRUSONA_SECRET']
  c.token          = ENV['TRUSONA_TOKEN']
end
```

The value of each required configuration parameter are provided by Trusona.

### Device and User Bindings

Before Trusonafications can be created for a user, the device registered with the Trusona Mobile SDK must be bound to a **unique-to-you** user identifier. The user identifier can be any value that helps you uniquely identify the user in your system.

Once this binding has been created, the user should be made to verify their account with your system. This may include:

* Email verification
* Logging in with existing credentials
* Answering security questions

Once the account has been verified, the Device and User Binding must be activated, which is your way of telling Trusona that this user is ready to accept Trusonafications.

#### Creating a Device and User Binding

The binding requires two values, the user identifier that helps you identify the user in your system and the device identifier as generated by the Trusona Mobile SDK on the user's device.

```ruby

  binding = Trusona::DeviceUserBinding.create(
    user: '83452353-4F7B-4CA2-BBCD-57ACE7279EA0',
    device: 'PBanKaajTmz_Cq1pDkrRzyeISBSBoGjExzp5r6-UjcI'
  )

```

#### Activating a Device and User Binding

```ruby
  # create the binding
  binding = Trusona::DeviceUserBinding.create(
    user: '83452353-4F7B-4CA2-BBCD-57ACE7279EA0',
    device: 'PBanKaajTmz_Cq1pDkrRzyeISBSBoGjExzp5r6-UjcI'
  )

  # go verify the user...

  # activate the binding
  Trusona::DeviceUserBinding.activate(id: binding.id)
```

### Trusonafications

#### Creating a Trusonafication

A simple Essential level Trusonafication

```ruby
  Trusona::EssentialTrusonafication.create(params: {
    action: 'login',
    resource: 'Acme Bank',
    device_identifier: 'PBanKaajTmz_Cq1pDkrRzyeISBSBoGjExzp5r6-UjcI'
   })
```

An Executive level Trusonafication

```ruby
  Trusona::ExecutiveTrusonafication.create(params: {
    action: 'login',
    resource: 'Acme Bank',
    device_identifier: 'PBanKaajTmz_Cq1pDkrRzyeISBSBoGjExzp5r6-UjcI'
   })
```

A more complex example, toggling optional fields

```ruby
  Trusona::EssentialTrusonafication.create(params: {
    action: 'login',
    resource: 'Acme Bank',
    device_identifier: 'PBanKaajTmz_Cq1pDkrRzyeISBSBoGjExzp5r6-UjcI',
    user_presence: false,
    prompt: false
   })
```



#### Trusonafication Options

|       Name        |   Parameter Name    | Required |                                                            Description                                                            |
| :---------------- | :------------------ | :------: | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Action            | `action`            |    Y     | The action you want the user to take (e.g. 'login', 'verify')                                                                     |
| Resource          | `resource`          |    Y     | The resource to which the user is performing the action (e.g. 'website', 'account')                                               |
| Device Identifier | `device_identifier` |    N[^1] | The device identifier, retrieved from the mobile SDK, of the device to which this Trusonafication will be sent.                   |
| User Identifier   | `user_identifier`   |    N[^1] | The user identifier that has been registered with Trusona.                                                                        |
| Tru Code ID       | `trucode_id`        |    N[^1] | A Tru Code ID that has/will be paired by a device using the Trusona Mobile SDK that can be used to lookup the `device_identifier` |
| User Presence     | `user_presence`     |    N     | Should the user be required to demonstrate presence (e.g. via Biometric) when accepting this Trusonafication? Defaults to `true`. |
| Prompt            | `prompt`            |    N     | Should the user be prompted to Accept or Reject this Trusonafication? Defaults to `true`.                                         |
| Callback URL      | `callback_url`      |    N     | A URL that will be called when the Trusonafication is completed.                                                                  |
| Expiration        | `expires_at`        |    N     | The ISO-8601 UTC timestamp of the Trusonafication's expiration. Defaults to 90 seconds from creation.                             |

[^1]: You must provide at least one field that would allow Trusona to determine which user to authenticate. The identifier fields are `device_identifier`, `user_identifier`, and `trucode_id`.

#### Retrieving an existing Trusonafication

After creating a Trusonafication, you can fetch that Trusonafication using the `id`.

```ruby
  trusonafication = Trusona::EssentialTrusonafication.create(params: {
    action: 'login',
    resource: 'Acme Bank',
    device_identifier: 'PBanKaajTmz_Cq1pDkrRzyeISBSBoGjExzp5r6-UjcI'
   })

   # ...

   updated = Trusona::Trusonafication.find(trusonafication.id)
```

#### Automatically polling for Trusonafication status

Sometimes, you want to send a Trusonafication and wait for its completion by the user before proceeding. This can be accomplished by passing a block, and optional timeout, when creating a Trusonafication.

```ruby
  params = {
    action: 'login',
    resource: 'Acme Bank',
    device_identifier: 'PBanKaajTmz_Cq1pDkrRzyeISBSBoGjExzp5r6-UjcI'
  }

  Trusona::EssentialTrusonafication.create(params: params) do | trusonafication |
    # Block will be executed when the user has acted on the Trusonafication
    # OR when the Trusonafication has expired.

    if trusonafication.accepted?
      # start the parade
    end
  end
```

### Devices

#### Finding a Device

If you want to check whether or not a device has been activated, or when it was activated, you can look it up in Trusona using the device's identifier.

```ruby
  device = Trusona::Device.find(id: 'r1ByVyVKJ7TRgU0RPX0-THMTD_CO3VrCSNqLpJFmhms')
  if device.active
    # dance
  end
```

## Development

### Patterns

The Trusona gem is built with a few principles in mind:

1. Provide a simple, idomatic, rails-like public interface.
1. Reduce the scope of the internals exposed to the end-user of the gem.

#### Workers

Behind the public facing API are a variety of Workers that complete simple, single-focused tasks. For example, when creating a Trusonafication, the responsibility of creation is offloaded to the `Trusona::Workers::TrusonaficationCreator`. This pattern is used for nearly all aspects of the SDK internals.

#### Services

Communicating with the Trusona API is done via a set of `Trusona::Services` which are responsible for making HMAC'd requests to the Trusona API and verifying the HMAC'd responses from the Trusona API.

#### Resources

Resources are designed to be simple representations of entities which are represented by the Trusona API.

#### Mappers

Mappers help translate JSON representations of Trusona API entities to Resource objects.

### Rubocop

`Rubocop` is used to ensure adherence to an known style guide. It can be run
from the command line. Rubocop standards are currently _not_ enforced during
continuous integration builds.

`bundle exec rubocop lib`

### Testing

`bundle exec rake`

#### Integration Tests

Included in the `integrations` directory are a set of ever growing integration tests which rely on the Trusona config variables in your environment (try `.env`.)

`bundle exec rspec integrations/`

#### Code Coverage

Code coverage is calculated used `SimpleCov` and can be found in the `coverage`
directory after running the tests

### Deployment

To deploy a new version of the gem to Artifactory, use `bump` to bump the
version by either `major`, `minor` or `patch` and then push the tags to
github. Travis CI will build and deploy any tagged commits.

1. Ensure a clean working directory
1. `bundle exec bump patch --tag`
1. `git push origin --tags`
